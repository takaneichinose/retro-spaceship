# Retro Spaceship
<p>Do not let 'em pass!</p>

<p>Just another simple retro-esque game I made, inspired by the 1980s game Galaga.</p>

<p>I used Base64 data for the images.</p>

Controls:<br />
Space bar: Launch fire<br />
Left arrow key: Move Left<br />
Right arrow key: Move right<br />

<p>I made this game before I had an access to the assets, so all of the assets I used here are just in Base64 format.</p>
