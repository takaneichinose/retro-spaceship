# Retro Spaceship
Do not let 'em pass!<br />

Just another simple retro-esque game I made, inspired by the 1980s game Galaga.<br />

I used Base64 data for the images.<br />

Controls:<br />
Space bar: Launch fire<br />
Left arrow key: Move Left<br />
Right arrow key: Move right<br />

I made this game before I had an access to the assets, so all of the assets I used here are just in Base64 format.
