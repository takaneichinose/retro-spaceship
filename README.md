# Retro Spaceship
Do not let 'em pass!

Just another simple retro-esque game I made, inspired by the 1980s game Galaga.

I used Base64 data for the images.

Controls:
Space bar: Launch fire
Left arrow key: Move Left
Right arrow key: Move right

I made this game before I had an access to the assets, so all of the assets I used here are just in Base64 format.
